					The main class of the application is the <b>BankViewer</b> class. Everything necessary for work is
					created in its constructor. First of all, this is the application window - an object of the JFrame
					class. To implement SDI, I use the BorderLayout() layout manager. In the central part, I place the
					JEditorPane. It will be used to display the bank statement as a table. In the upper part, I place
					the toolbar, in the lower part - the status bar.</p>
				<p>
					The main application window has a menu attached to it. The context menu is attached to the
					JEditorPane, and, as already mentioned, the toolbar is displayed. All three of these objects are
					created by methods of the <b>Act</b> class. Each menu item or toolbar button is an object of the
					Action class. All the necessary Actions are created by methods of the Act class. That is why this is
					probably the largest class in this program by the number of lines. But it is also probably the
					simplest class in this program, because all Actions are created in the same way, and the menu
					and toolbar are just a listing of the necessary Actions in the right order. However, there are some
					small nuances that are easy to understand by looking at the class text.
				</p>
				<p>
					The status bar is an object of the <b>StatusBar</b> class. Actually, the status bar is a JPanel
					in which three JTextFields are located in a row. The class has three methods for issuing a string
					message to the corresponding JTextField. The far right field is a little special: the message
					displayed in it will be visible for 5 seconds, and then it disappears. Of course, the status bar can
					be infinitely complicated and improved, but for this program such a status bar is quite enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					Swing provides the JTable class to display information in the form of a table. But there is
					another way: JEditorPane, to which the setPage(URL u) method was passed the URL of an HTML file in
					which the table was formed by the &lt;table&gt; ... &lt;/table&gt; tags. I use the second option.
					So, the main thing in the program is to convert the original text file "key-value" into an HTML
					file. Then the HTML file is passed to display the same JeditorPane, which is located in the central
					part of the main application window. Everything else is the implementation of SDI and ensuring the
					usability of the program.
				</p>
				<p>
					The program opens files to display them in a table. Swing provides a ready-made window for
					specifying the file to be opened: this is the javax.swing.JFileChooser class. The <b>Filer</b> class
					is just a shell around it, allowing you to slightly customize the appearance and behavior.
				</p>
				<p>
					Filer requires an object of the LastFiles class to work. <b>LastFiles</b>, using the Proper class (a
					wrapper for the java.util.Properties class), stores and can read several special strings when
					the program is launched - these are the paths to the last opened files. It is very convenient to see
					them in the File menu and quickly specify the desired one instead of using the file open window.
					Filer, on the other hand, saves the path to a file in the LastFiles class object every time it
					successfully opens. If the file is not opened successfully, it deletes such a path from the
					saved list, if there is one, of course. LastFiles provides the put() and remove() methods for these
					actions. In addition, there is a getList() method, with the help of which Act forms a fragment
					of the File menu with a list of the last opened files from the list of paths.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the user has specified a file, then Filer will call the only public convert() method of the
					<b>Convertor</b> class in the open() method. This method converts the original file with data in the
					form of key-value pairs into an HTML file with the same data presented in the form of a table. Then
					this HTML file will be passed to JEditorPane, which will parse it and display it without any
					intervention from the programmer.
				</p>
				<p>
					What Java program does not allow the user to install Look & Fill? This program is no exception.
					In the "View" menu, the user can select any Look & Fill available in his system. The <b>LaF</b>
					class helps to work with this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <b>Finder</b> class was created to implement the search in the displayed file.
					<b>FinderFrame</b> is a window for specifying the search string, which is a set of javax.swing
					components. The search algorithm is implemented in the Finder class. When creating FinderFrame, the
					problem of placing components arose, and the GBL class was created to solve it. <b>GBL</b> is a
					simplification of the GridBagLayout layout manager, adapted to the needs of the application.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is worth paying attention to the <b>Proper</b> class. This is a class that is a wrapper for the
					java.util.Properties class. The read() method reads a file with previously recorded data of an
					object of the java.util.Properties class. The save() method does the opposite: it writes
					everything that is placed in the object to a file. The class is needed so that the application can
					save some data between sessions. This saves the location and size of the main window, paths to
					several recently opened files, an indicator of whether to display the toolbar, the status bar, the
					last entered search string, and some other data. For ease of use, a pair of methods have been made:
					setProperty(name, value) and getProperty(name, def), where value can be a string or an integer.
					It is clear that the first method saves some value named name, and the second reads the value name,
					and if it was not written, then the value def will be returned. To write and restore the location
					and size of the application window, a pair of methods saveBounds() and setBounds() are used.
				</p>
				<p>
					The program has tested internationalization (i18n). The <b>Loc</b> class is used for this. All
					phrases that are intended for display are written in English using underscores instead of spaces. If
					the messages_ru.properties file contains a translation for such a phrase, it will be used for
					display. Otherwise, the underscores in the English phrase will be replaced with spaces, and the
					first letter will be made capital. And the resulting one will be used for display. For the purposes
					of this program, this is quite sufficient.
